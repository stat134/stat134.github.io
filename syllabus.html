		<h3 id=level-1>Academic Honesty</h3>
			<p id=level-2>Being an online class academic honesty is of particular concern. I will do everything I can to remove incentives for you to feel like you need to cheat.  Please know that I take the Berkeley honor code very seriously and have years of experience catching cheaters. If we suspect someone of cheating, we reserve the right to give the student an oral quiz or exam and test if the student understands what they wrote.</p>
            <p id=level-2>Please familiarize yourself with UCBs Academic Honesty Policy (see the Center for Student Conduct website: <a href=http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct target="_blank">http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct</a>). ). I encourage you to discuss homework problems with other students and to work together, but copying is never appropriate. (You should never write down anything you don't understand!) I strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the definition of plagiarism, and to avoid engaging in
it. <b>Violations of the UCB’s Academic Honesty Policy, including instances of plagiarism, will be reported to the University</b> and an appropriate penalty will be implemented. (This may range from a failing grade on an assignment to an “F” for the course, in addition to writing letters of reflection and apology to UCB’s administration.)</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <p id=level-2>TL;DR Don't. <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="toggle_tldr">Why?</a></p>
                </div>

                <div id="tldr_long" style="display:none">
                    <p id=level-2>There is a big distinction between understanding a solution and being able to produce it yourself. When you read a solution presented in a solution manual, you will undoubtably understand it; however, this does not mean that you will be able to produce a similar solution yourself at another time. If you don't believe me, just <a href=https://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand target="_blank">ask Richard Feynman</a>. Solution manuals often give the illusion of proficiency; more often than not, this illusion is cruelly shattered by exams.</p>

                    <p id=level-2>This trap is very easy to fall into and is indeed one that many a good student (myself included) have fallen prey to. In a course like Stat 134 where the problems you face are especially tricky, a large part of the learning process is struggling through problems and confronting the bleak sense of helplessness you might feel when faced with a problem unlike anything you've seen before. It is hard to find many things more rewarding in life than that "Eureka" moment, that arises after hours of hard, fruitless labour, when what seemed so opaque merely seconds prior becomes so suddenly and entirely clear. Don't deprive yourself of the beauty of such moments.</p>

                    <p id=level-2>Do yourself a favour and don't use solution manuals, even if to just "check your work". If you need help with the homework assignments, please reach out to the GSIs or make use of any one of the SLC's many services.</p>
